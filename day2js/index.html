        <h1>DAY-2 JS IP</h1>
        1.Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind().
        ans: .call(){dot call function}methods input format,1st is always the object calling the function followed by the arguments.
              arguments are passed as comma seperated
             .apply(){dot apply function} methods input format,1 st is always the object calling the functions by the arguments.
             arguments are passed in the form of an array.
             .bind(){dot bind function}methods it will return a new function this new function can be used anytime and anywhere.


        2.What are objects in javascript?
        ans. An object in js comes under non premitive data type. 
        object is a container/entity which can store the multiple things in form of keys and values.
       
       
        3.What are function constructors?
        ans. functions constructor is a kind of regular function create multiple objects at a time.
        When creating function construtcor,it is good pratice to keep the first letterr of the name,captital.
        new and this keyword is mandatory to be used with function constructor.
        
        
        4.Explain prototypes.
        ans.The prototype is an object that is assoiated with every functions and objects by default in js,
        functions prototype is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype is not visible.
        every function includes prototype object by default.
        
        5.What is prototype chain. 
        ans.JS objects have a link to a prototype object.When trying to access a proprty of an object, the property will not
        only be sought on the object but on the prototype of the object, the prototype of prototype and so on until eighter a 
        proprty with a matching name is found or the end of the prototype chain is reached. 
        
        
        6.Give an example of inheritance using function constructor.
        ans.Inheritance-Inheriting the properties and the methods from any other objects.

        
        7.What are callbacks?
        ans. Call Back: function which is passed as an argument to other function.
        
        
        8.What is the use of setTimeout
        ans. set timeout:with the use of it the block of code can be executed after particular time period which is in milliseconds.
        it is a call back it is need because "JS" is an event driven language that means insted of waiting for response  js keep executing  while listening for another events.

        9.What are pure functions?
        ans. A pure function is a function that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed.
        it does not depend on any state or data change during a program's execution.
        it depends only on its input arguments.
